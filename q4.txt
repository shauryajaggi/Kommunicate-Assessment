The best project I have worked on has been an Airport Management System.
This project uses simple frontend using HTML/CSS and backend using PHP.
The functionalities included signing up, checking for flights on a specific date from different locations, a payment gateway page (does not actually work yet, looking to implement it using Stripe) and a booking confirmation page.
