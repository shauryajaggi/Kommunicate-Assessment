The two people from my batch who I'd like to start my software company with would be:
1) Tushar Tandon: He's a Java Developer and is very good at his job. He is a geek and I could count on him to be the tech lead for the company. He iis well versed in many stacks and technologies. I could count on him to hire exactly the people we would need to get a certain job done.
2) Tarun Soni: Tarun is someone with whom I discuss real life problems that require a solution. We come up with new solutions all the time and find a way software would help us solve it.
These are the two people I'd trust to get the job done and make the company not only sustainable but also aimed towards solving real life problems.
